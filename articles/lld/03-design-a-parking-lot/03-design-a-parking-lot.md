## Overview (Problem statement)

**Design the classes and relationships for a parking lot that:**

- Has multiple floors
- Supports different vehicle types (bike, car, truck)
- Can tell you if a spot is available
- Can assign a spot to a vehicle and release it

## Entities & Classes

**1\. Vehicle (Base Class + Subtypes)**

Rather than completely separate unrelated classes, we use inheritance. All vehicles share common attributes, but type matters for spot assignment.

```java
public enum VehicleType {
    BIKE, CAR, TRUCK
}

public abstract class Vehicle {
    private String licensePlate;
    private VehicleType type;

    public Vehicle(String licensePlate, VehicleType type) {
        this.licensePlate = licensePlate;
        this.type = type;
    }

    public VehicleType getType() { return type; }
    public String getLicensePlate() { return licensePlate; }
}

public class Car extends Vehicle {
    public Car(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleType.CAR);
    }
}

public class Bike extends Vehicle {
    public Bike(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleType.BIKE);
    }
}

public class Truck extends Vehicle {
    public Truck(String licensePlate) {
        super(licensePlate, VehicleType.TRUCK);
    }
}
```

**2\. Spot Class**

A spot knows its own ID, which vehicle type it supports, and when it was occupied.

```java
public class Spot implements Comparable<Spot> {
    private String spotId;
    private VehicleType supportedType;
    private Vehicle currentVehicle;
    private LocalDateTime entryTime;
    private int floorNumber;
    private double pricePerHour;

    public Spot(String spotId, VehicleType supportedType, int floorNumber, double pricePerHour) {
        this.spotId = spotId;
        this.supportedType = supportedType;
        this.floorNumber = floorNumber;
        this.pricePerHour = pricePerHour;
    }

    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return currentVehicle == null;
    }

    public void assignVehicle(Vehicle v) {
        this.currentVehicle = v;
        this.entryTime = LocalDateTime.now();
    }

    public void removeVehicle() {
        this.currentVehicle = null;
        this.entryTime = null;
    }

    public LocalDateTime getEntryTime() { return entryTime; }
    public Vehicle getCurrentVehicle() { return currentVehicle; }
    public String getSpotId() { return spotId; }
    public int getFloorNumber() { return floorNumber; }
    public double getPricePerHour() { return pricePerHour; }
    public VehicleType getSupportedType() { return supportedType; }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Spot other) {
        return Integer.compare(this.floorNumber, other.floorNumber);
    }
}
```

**3\. Floor Class**

A floor has spots. That's it. It doesn't manage availability. That's the ParkingLot's job.

```java
public class Floor {
    private int floorNumber;
    private List<Spot> spots;

    public Floor(int floorNumber) {
        this.floorNumber = floorNumber;
        this.spots = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addSpot(Spot spot) {
        spots.add(spot);
    }

    public List<Spot> getSpots() { return spots; }
    public int getFloorNumber() { return floorNumber; }
}
```

**4\. ParkingLot Class**

The ParkingLot is a container for floors, but also owns the availability tracking. It uses:

```java
Map<VehicleType, PriorityQueue<Spot>> availableSpots
```

The PriorityQueue orders spots by floor number, so the nearest floor spot is always assigned first : O(1) fetch, O(log n) reinsert.

```java
public class ParkingLot {
    private String name;
    private List<Floor> floors;
    private Map<VehicleType, PriorityQueue<Spot>> availableSpots;

    public ParkingLot(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.floors = new ArrayList<>();
        this.availableSpots = new HashMap<>();

        for (VehicleType type : VehicleType.values()) {
            availableSpots.put(type, new PriorityQueue<>());
        }
    }

    public void addFloor(Floor floor) {
        floors.add(floor);
        for (Spot spot : floor.getSpots()) {
            availableSpots.get(spot.getSupportedType()).offer(spot);
        }
    }

    public Spot assignSpot(Vehicle vehicle) {
        PriorityQueue<Spot> queue = availableSpots.get(vehicle.getType());

        if (queue == null || queue.isEmpty()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("No available spot for vehicle type: " + vehicle.getType());
        }

        Spot spot = queue.poll();
        spot.assignVehicle(vehicle);
        return spot;
    }

    public double releaseSpot(Spot spot) {
        LocalDateTime exitTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        double bill = BillingService.calculateBill(spot, exitTime);
        spot.removeVehicle();
        availableSpots.get(spot.getSupportedType()).offer(spot);
        return bill;
    }
}
```

**5\. BillingService Class**

Single responsibility i.e. just calculates the bill. Takes a spot (which has entry time and price per hour) and an exit time.

```java
public class BillingService {

    public static double calculateBill(Spot spot, LocalDateTime exitTime) {
        LocalDateTime entryTime = spot.getEntryTime();
        long minutes = Duration.between(entryTime, exitTime).toMinutes();
        double hours = Math.ceil(minutes / 60.0); 
        return hours * spot.getPricePerHour();
    }
}
```

## Class Relationship Summary

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HI7ZfgFbAAAQa7A.jpg)

**Aggregation vs Composition:**

- ParkingLot -\> Floor: **Composition** (floors don't exist without the lot)
- Floor -\> Spot: **Composition**
- Spot -\> Vehicle: **Aggregation** (vehicle exists independently, just parked here)

Key design decisions that were imp here:

**Base Vehicle class** : Avoids duplication, type is just an enum field

**Spot implements Comparable** : Enables PriorityQueue to sort by floor number natively

**Map<VehicleType, PriorityQueue<Spot\>\>**: O(1) type lookup, O(log n) spot assignment which is way better than O(n) scan

**BillingService as a separate class**: Single Responsibility as billing logic doesn't belong on Spot or ParkingLot

**Floor as a dumb container**: Floor doesn't manage availability, keeps it simple and focused

That's all folks, Cheers!!! Do like, comment, repost and share though
