## The Foundation

Low-Level Design is the art of translating a system's requirements into clean, maintainable code structures. Before diving into questions like design a parking lot, a chess game, or a ride-sharing system, we need to command the fundamentals: OOP, design principles, and design patterns. This article covers all three.

## 1\. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is the backbone of LLD. Everything you design will be expressed through classes, objects, and their relationships.

**The four pillars:**

**Encapsulation**

Bundle data and the methods that operate on it into a single unit (class), and restrict direct access to the internals.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // hidden from outside

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

Nobody outside this class can directly touch balance. They must go through the controlled interface. This is encapsulation, and it protects your data's integrity.

**Abstraction**

Abstraction means hiding the complexity and exposing only what the caller needs. In Java, this is done with abstract classes and interfaces.

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);
    boolean refund(double amount);
}

public class StripeProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    @Override
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        // Stripe-specific HTTP calls, auth, retries are all hidden
        System.out.println("Processing $" + amount + " via Stripe");
    }

    @Override
    public boolean refund(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Refunding $" + amount + " via Stripe");
        return true;
    }
}
```

The caller only knows about PaymentProcessor. It doesn't care whether Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal is underneath.

**Inheritance**

A child class inherits fields and methods from a parent, extending or specializing its behavior.

```java
public class Vehicle {
    protected String brand;
    protected int speed;

    public Vehicle(String brand, int speed) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.speed = speed;
    }

    public void move() {
        System.out.println(brand + " is moving at " + speed + " km/h");
    }
}

public class ElectricCar extends Vehicle {
    private int batteryLevel;

    public ElectricCar(String brand, int speed, int batteryLevel) {
        super(brand, speed);
        this.batteryLevel = batteryLevel;
    }

    public void chargeBattery() {
        System.out.println("Charging " + brand + "... Battery: " + batteryLevel + "%");
    }
}
```

ElectricCar gets move() for free and adds chargeBattery() on top. Inheritance is powerful but prefer composition over inheritance when the relationship isn't a clean "is-a."

**Polymorphism**

One interface, many forms. The right method is picked at runtime.

```java
public class Shape {
    public double area() {
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    private double radius;
    public Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width, height;
    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width; this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

// Usage
List<Shape> shapes = List.of(new Circle(5), new Rectangle(4, 6));
for (Shape s : shapes) {
    System.out.println("Area: " + s.area()); // correct method picked at runtime
}
```

The loop doesn't care what kind of Shape it holds, it just calls area() and gets the right answer.

## 2\. SOLID Design Principles

SOLID is a set of five principles that make your code easier to extend and harder to break. They're the rules that separate good LLD from great LLD.

**S - Single Responsibility Principle**

A class should have only one reason to change.

```java
// BAD: this class does too many things
public class UserService {
    public void saveUser(User user) { /* DB logic */ }
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(User user) { /* Email logic */ }
    public String generateReport(User user) { /* Report logic */ }
}

// GOOD: each class owns one concern
public class UserRepository {
    public void save(User user) { /* DB logic only */ }
}

public class EmailService {
    public void sendWelcomeEmail(User user) { /* Email only */ }
}

public class UserReportGenerator {
    public String generate(User user) { /* Report only */ }
}
```

If you change the email template, only EmailService changes. Nothing else breaks.

**O - Open/Closed Principle**

Open for extension, closed for modification. Add new behavior by adding new code, not editing existing code.

```java
public interface DiscountStrategy {
    double apply(double price);
}

public class SeasonalDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double apply(double price) { return price * 0.9; }
}

public class LoyaltyDiscount implements DiscountStrategy {
    public double apply(double price) { return price * 0.85; }
}

public class PriceCalculator {
    public double finalPrice(double price, DiscountStrategy strategy) {
        return strategy.apply(price);
    }
}
```

Tomorrow if a new "Student Discount" is needed, you add a new class. You never touch PriceCalculator.

**L - Liskov Substitution Principle**

A subclass should be fully substitutable for its parent without breaking the program.

```java
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying...");
    }
}

// VIOLATION: Penguin can't fly so substituting Bird with Penguin breaks callers
public class Penguin extends Bird {
    @Override
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins can't fly!");
    }
}

// Good practice: Redesign the hierarchy
public interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

public class Sparrow implements Flyable {
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Sparrow flying"); }
}

public class Penguin {
    public void swim() { System.out.println("Penguin swimming"); }
}
```

If a subclass breaks the contract of the parent, the inheritance itself is wrong.

**I - Interface Segregation Principle**

Don't force a class to implement methods it doesn't need. Prefer many small, focused interfaces over one fat interface.

```java
// BAD: one bloated interface
public interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
    void sleep();
}

// A robot worker shouldn't implement eat() and sleep()
// GOOD: split by capability
public interface Workable { void work(); }
public interface Eatable   { void eat();  }
public interface Sleepable { void sleep(); }

public class HumanWorker implements Workable, Eatable, Sleepable {
    public void work()  { System.out.println("Human working");  }
    public void eat()   { System.out.println("Human eating");   }
    public void sleep() { System.out.println("Human sleeping"); }
}

public class RobotWorker implements Workable {
    public void work() { System.out.println("Robot working"); }
}
```

**D-Dependency Inversion Principle**

High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

```java
// BAD: high-level class is tightly coupled to a specific DB
public class OrderService {
    private MySQLDatabase db = new MySQLDatabase(); // concrete dependency
    public void placeOrder(Order order) { db.save(order); }
}

// GOOD: depend on an interface
public interface Database {
    void save(Order order);
}

public class MySQLDatabase implements Database {
    public void save(Order order) { System.out.println("Saving to MySQL"); }
}

public class MongoDatabase implements Database {
    public void save(Order order) { System.out.println("Saving to MongoDB"); }
}

public class OrderService {
    private final Database db;

    public OrderService(Database db) { // injected from outside
        this.db = db;
    }

    public void placeOrder(Order order) { db.save(order); }
}
```

Now you can swap MySQLDatabase for MongoDatabase without touching OrderService.

## 3\. Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems. They are not complete programs, but proven templates that help developers solve recurring issues efficiently. There are three categories: Let's look at three patterns you'll use constantly in LLD interviews and real-world systems.

Design patterns are mainly divided into three categories:

Creational Design Patterns

Structural Design Patterns

Behavioral Design Patterns

## **1\. Creational Design Patterns**

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms.

**Singleton Pattern**

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a class exists throughout the application.

This pattern is commonly used in:

- Logging systems
- Database connections
- Configuration managers
- Cache systems
```java
class Singleton {

    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {

        if(instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }

        return instance;
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Singleton s1 = Singleton.getInstance();
        Singleton s2 = Singleton.getInstance();

        System.out.println(s1 == s2);
    }
}
```

**Factory Pattern**

The Factory pattern creates objects without exposing the object creation logic to the client. Instead of creating objects directly using 'new', the factory decides which object should be created.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving Car");
    }
}

class Bike implements Vehicle {

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving Bike");
    }
}

class VehicleFactory {

    static Vehicle getVehicle(String type) {

        if(type.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
            return new Car();
        }

        return new Bike();
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Vehicle vehicle = VehicleFactory.getVehicle("car");

        vehicle.drive();
    }
}
```

Advantages

- Loose coupling
- Better scalability
- Cleaner object creation

**Builder Pattern**

The Builder pattern is used to construct complex objects step by step. It is especially useful when a class contains many fields.

```java
class User {

    private String name;
    private int age;

    private User(UserBuilder builder) {
        this.name = builder.name;
        this.age = builder.age;
    }

    static class UserBuilder {

        private String name;
        private int age;

        UserBuilder setName(String name) {
            this.name = name;
            return this;
        }

        UserBuilder setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        User user = new User.UserBuilder()
                            .setName("Harry")
                            .setAge(22)
                            .build();
    }
}
```

## 2\. Structural Design Patterns

Structural patterns deal with how classes and objects are organized.

**Adapter Pattern**

The Adapter pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together. A real-world example is a charger adapter.

```java
interface AndroidCharger {
    void charge();
}

class IphoneCharger {

    void chargeIphone() {
        System.out.println("Charging iPhone");
    }
}

class ChargerAdapter implements AndroidCharger {

    private IphoneCharger iphoneCharger;

    ChargerAdapter(IphoneCharger iphoneCharger) {
        this.iphoneCharger = iphoneCharger;
    }

    public void charge() {
        iphoneCharger.chargeIphone();
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        AndroidCharger charger =
                new ChargerAdapter(new IphoneCharger());

        charger.charge();
    }
}
```

Advantages

- Improves compatibility
- Encourages code reuse
- Reduces dependency issues

**Decorator Pattern**

The Decorator pattern dynamically adds new functionality to objects without modifying their structure.

```java
interface Coffee {
    int cost();
}

class BasicCoffee implements Coffee {

    public int cost() {
        return 100;
    }
}

class MilkDecorator implements Coffee {

    private Coffee coffee;

    MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    public int cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 20;
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Coffee coffee =
                new MilkDecorator(new BasicCoffee());

        System.out.println(coffee.cost());
    }
}
```

Output

```
120
```

The milk functionality is added dynamically.

**Facade Pattern**

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system. Instead of exposing every subsystem directly, the facade offers a single entry point.

```java
class CPU {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("CPU Started");
    }
}

class RAM {
    void load() {
        System.out.println("RAM Loaded");
    }
}

class HardDrive {
    void read() {
        System.out.println("Hard Drive Read");
    }
}

class ComputerFacade {

    private CPU cpu = new CPU();
    private RAM ram = new RAM();
    private HardDrive hardDrive = new HardDrive();

    void startComputer() {

        cpu.start();
        ram.load();
        hardDrive.read();
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ComputerFacade computer = new ComputerFacade();

        computer.startComputer();
    }
}
```

## 3\. Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects.

**Observer Pattern**

The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency where multiple objects are notified automatically when one object changes.

Examples include:

- YouTube subscriptions
- Notification systems
- Event listeners
```java
import java.util.*;

interface Observer {
    void update(String message);
}

class User implements Observer {

    private String name;

    User(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void update(String message) {
        System.out.println(name + " received: " + message);
    }
}

class YoutubeChannel {

    private List<Observer> subscribers = new ArrayList<>();

    void subscribe(Observer observer) {
        subscribers.add(observer);
    }

    void notifyUsers(String video) {

        for(Observer observer : subscribers) {
            observer.update(video);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        YoutubeChannel channel = new YoutubeChannel();

        channel.subscribe(new User("Harry"));
        channel.subscribe(new User("Alex"));

        channel.notifyUsers("New video uploaded");
    }
}
```

**Strategy Pattern**

The Strategy pattern allows selecting behavior dynamically at runtime.

This pattern is heavily used in:

- Payment systems
- Sorting mechanisms
- Authentication providers
```java
interface PaymentStrategy {
    void pay(int amount);
}

class CardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {

    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid using Card");
    }
}

class UpiPayment implements PaymentStrategy {

    public void pay(int amount) {
        System.out.println("Paid using UPI");
    }
}

class ShoppingCart {

    private PaymentStrategy strategy;

    ShoppingCart(PaymentStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    void checkout(int amount) {
        strategy.pay(amount);
    }
}

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ShoppingCart cart =
                new ShoppingCart(new UpiPayment());

        cart.checkout(1000);
    }
}
```

**How it all connects**

OOP gives you the building blocks. SOLID gives you the rules for using those blocks well. Design patterns give you proven blueprints for common situations.

In the next article of this series, we'll apply everything here to a real LLD problem : **designing a Parking Lot System** from scratch, with class diagrams and full Java code.

That's all, folks....Cheers!
