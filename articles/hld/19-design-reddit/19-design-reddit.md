## High-Level Design: Reddit

## **1\. Requirements**

**Functional Requirements**

- Create posts (text, image, video)
- Upvote and downvote posts and comments
- Threaded nested comments
- Join subreddits and follow users
- Home feed based on joined subreddits
- Subreddit feed with sorting modes: Hot, New, Top, Controversial
- Search for posts, subreddits, and users
- Create a subreddit

Out of Scope

- Chat (same WebSocket architecture as Tinder)
- Reddit Awards and coins
- Moderation tools
- Reddit Ads

**Non-Functional Requirements**

- High availability across feed, voting, and media serving
- Low latency feed reads under 100ms
- Votes must never be lost even under traffic spikes
- Hotness scores must reflect recent activity with time decay
- Eventual consistency acceptable for vote counts and feed ranking
- Strong consistency required for vote idempotency (a user cannot vote twice on the same post)

## 2\. Capacity Estimation

- **DAU:** 50 million
- **Posts per day:** 10 million (20% of DAU)
- **Average post size:** ~2 MB weighted average across text (100 KB), images (500 KB to 1 MB), and videos (up to 10 MB)
- **Post storage per day:** 10M x 2 MB = 20 TB/day
- **Votes per day:** 50M DAU x 5 votes each = 250 million votes/day = ~3000 votes/second at peak, with viral spikes far higher
- **Comments per day:** roughly 100 million (2 comments per DAU on average)

The dominant write load is votes at 3000 per second, not posts. Every vote potentially triggers a hotness score recomputation. This is the primary design constraint for the voting and feed systems. Media storage at 20 TB/day is significant but manageable with S3 and CDN caching.

## 3\. API Gateway

All client requests enter through the API Gateway which handles authentication, rate limiting, and routing. The same constraint applies as in every previous design: the API Gateway is never in the path of binary media payloads. Image and video uploads bypass the Gateway after authentication using a presigned S3 URL for direct client-to-S3 upload.

## 4\. Post Service and Upload Pipeline

**Upload Flow**

When a user creates a post with media:

Client authenticates via API Gateway and requests a presigned S3 URL from the Post Service

Client uploads media directly to S3 using the presigned URL

S3 emits an upload event which triggers the Transcoding Service via Kafka

The Transcoding Service processes media:Images: generates thumbnail, medium, and full resolution variants, applies compression and WebP conversion Videos: generates multiple quality variants (360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p), chunks into HLS segments for adaptive streaming, generates a thumbnail frame

All variants are written back to S3 under a deterministic path: media/{post\_id}/{variant}/

Transcoding completes and publishes a post.transcoded event to Kafka

Two consumers pick up the event independently:**Metadata Worker** writes post metadata to the Posts DB and populates the Post Metadata Cache in Redis **Search Indexing Worker** indexes the post into Elasticsearch

For text-only posts, steps 1 through 6 are skipped entirely. The Post Service writes directly to the Posts DB and publishes a post.created event to Kafka.

**Data Model**

**Posts Table (PostgreSQL)**

Posts post\_id UUID, primary key subreddit\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Subreddits user\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Users title VARCHAR content TEXT (null for media posts) media\_url TEXT (null for text posts) media\_type ENUM('text', 'image', 'video') upvotes INTEGER downvotes INTEGER score INTEGER hot\_score FLOAT posted\_at TIMESTAMP

upvotes, downvotes, score, and hot\_score are denormalized counters maintained asynchronously via Kafka consumers. This avoids expensive aggregation queries at read time.

**Subreddits Table (PostgreSQL)**

Subreddits subreddit\_id UUID, primary key name VARCHAR, unique description TEXT member\_count INTEGER created\_by UUID, foreign key -\> Users created\_at TIMESTAMP

**SubredditMembers Table (PostgreSQL)**

SubredditMembers user\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Users subreddit\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Subreddits joined\_at TIMESTAMP PRIMARY KEY (user\_id, subreddit\_id)

This is a many-to-many join table. Joining a subreddit is an INSERT, leaving is a DELETE. "Give me all subreddits user X has joined" is a simple WHERE user\_id = X query.

**Bottlenecks in the Post Service**

The Post Service itself is stateless and horizontally scalable. The Transcoding Service is the bottleneck for media posts since generating multiple video quality variants is CPU-intensive. This is handled by running the Transcoding Service as a horizontally scalable worker pool pulling jobs from a Kafka topic. Text posts have no bottleneck.

## 5\. Voting Service

Voting is the highest volume write path in the system at 3000 votes per second on average, with extreme spikes on viral posts. The voting system must handle burst traffic without data loss, prevent duplicate votes, and keep hotness scores up to date.

Full Vote Flow

**Step 1 - Receive Vote** Client sends POST /votes with { user\_id, post\_id, direction: 'up' | 'down' } to the Vote Service via API Gateway.

**Step 2 - Idempotency Check in Redis** Before any processing, the Vote Service checks whether the user has already voted on this post using a Redis Set:

SGET vote:user\_123:post\_456

If the user has already voted the same direction, the request is ignored. If the user is switching their vote (upvote to downvote), the delta is computed and processed. This idempotency check happens entirely in Redis on the hot path without touching the database.

**Step 3 - Increment Vote Counter in Redis** Vote counters are updated immediately in Redis:

INCR post:post\_456:upvotes

Clients read vote counts from Redis, not from the database. This ensures near real-time vote count updates on viral posts without any database read pressure.

**Step 4 - Publish to Kafka** The Vote Service publishes a vote.created event to Kafka immediately after the Redis update. This decouples the hot path from all downstream processing and provides durability. Even if downstream services are temporarily slow, no vote is lost.

**Step 5 - Kafka Consumers** Three consumers process the event independently:

**Vote Persistence Worker** writes the vote to the Votes Table in PostgreSQL asynchronously. This is the permanent record of every vote.

**Score Recomputation Worker** recomputes the hotness score for the post. Reddit's hotness algorithm is a function of the net upvote score and the time elapsed since the post was created. Newer posts with fewer upvotes can outrank older posts with more upvotes because the time decay factor penalizes age aggressively. The recomputed score is written back to the Redis Sorted Set:

ZADD subreddit:programming:hot <new\_hot\_score\> post\_456

The subreddit's Hot feed is updated instantly without any read-time computation.

**Controversial Score Worker** separately computes the controversial score. A post is controversial when it has a high total vote count but a nearly equal upvote/downvote split. This score is written to a separate sorted set:

ZADD subreddit:programming:controversial <controversial\_score\> post\_456

**Step 6 - Periodic Reconciliation** Redis vote counters are the fast read path. PostgreSQL is the source of truth. A background job periodically reconciles Redis counters against the database to catch any drift caused by Redis restarts or missed events.

**Votes Table (PostgreSQL)**

Votes vote\_id UUID, primary key user\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Users post\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Posts direction ENUM('up', 'down') voted\_at TIMESTAMP UNIQUE (user\_id, post\_id)

The UNIQUE constraint on (user\_id, post\_id) enforces vote idempotency at the database level as a safety net, even though the Redis check handles it on the hot path.

Bottlenecks in the Voting Service

The Redis operations are sub-millisecond and handle the peak vote throughput comfortably. Kafka absorbs burst traffic from viral posts. The Score Recomputation Worker can become a bottleneck if a single post receives thousands of votes per second, since each vote triggers a recomputation. This is mitigated by debouncing recomputation in the worker: instead of recomputing on every single vote event, the worker batches vote events for the same post within a short window (say 5 seconds) and recomputes once per window. This reduces recomputation overhead by orders of magnitude on viral posts while keeping scores fresh.

## 6\. Feed Service

Reddit's feed is subreddit-based, not follow-based. A user joins 50 subreddits. The home feed shows the best posts across all 50 subreddits, ranked by the selected sorting mode.

Redis Sorted Sets per Subreddit per Sorting Mode

Each subreddit maintains four Redis Sorted Sets, one per sorting mode:

subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:hot scored by hot\_score (upvotes + time decay) subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:new scored by posted\_at timestamp subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:top scored by net upvote count subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:controversial scored by controversial score

These are updated in real time by Kafka consumers as votes come in and new posts are created. Feed reads are always served from Redis and never touch the Posts DB directly in the happy path.

**Fan-out Strategy**

Reddit uses a hybrid fan-out model similar to Instagram but based on subreddit size rather than user follower count:

**Fan-out on write (small subreddits):** When a post is created in a small subreddit (below a member threshold, say 100,000 members), the Feed Fanout Worker writes the post directly into the home feed sorted sets of all members. Each member's home feed is a Redis Sorted Set:

Key: feed:{user\_id}:home Member: post\_id Score: hot\_score

**Fan-out on read (large subreddits):** For large subreddits like r/programming or r/worldnews with millions of members, fan-out on write is impractical. Instead, their subreddit sorted sets are read directly at feed request time and merged with the user's precomputed home feed. A post going viral in r/worldnews does not trigger writes to millions of home feed sorted sets.

Home Feed Read Flow

When a user opens Reddit:

Feed Service fetches the user's joined subreddits from the SubredditMembers cache in Redis

For small subreddits: reads from the precomputed feed:{user\_id}:home sorted set

For large subreddits: reads top posts directly from subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:hot

Merges and re-ranks results across all subreddits

Returns top 25 post IDs to the client

Feed Service hydrates post IDs via Redis MGET post:1 post:2 ... post:25

On cache miss for any post, falls back to Posts DB and writes back to Redis

Client renders feed with full post metadata and media URLs pointing to CDN

**Subreddit Feed Read Flow**

When a user opens a specific subreddit with a sorting mode:

Feed Service reads directly from subreddit:{subreddit\_id}:{sort\_mode} sorted set

ZREVRANGE subreddit:programming:hot 0 24 returns top 25 post IDs instantly

Post metadata hydrated via Redis MGET

Media served via CDN

Bottlenecks in the Feed Service

The merge step for large subreddits at read time adds latency proportional to the number of large subreddits a user follows. This is mitigated by capping the number of large subreddit reads per request and caching the merged result in Redis with a short TTL (30-60 seconds) per user. Home feed sorted sets for inactive users are evicted from Redis and rebuilt from the Posts DB on next login.

## 7\. Comment Service

Threaded nested comments are Reddit's most distinctive data structure challenge. A comment can have replies, those replies can have replies, to arbitrary depth. Each comment has its own upvote/downvote score.

Adjacency List Data Model

The comment tree is stored using the Adjacency List pattern in PostgreSQL. Each comment stores a reference to its parent:

**Comments** comment\_id UUID, primary key post\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Posts parent\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Comments (NULL for top-level comments) user\_id UUID, foreign key -\> Users content TEXT upvotes INTEGER downvotes INTEGER score INTEGER created\_at TIMESTAMP

A parent\_id of NULL means the comment is a direct reply to the post. A non-null parent\_id means it is a reply to another comment. This single column captures the entire tree structure without a graph database.

A composite index on (post\_id, parent\_id) makes the two primary queries fast:

```
Top-level comments for a post, sorted by score
SELECT * FROM Comments
WHERE post_id = X AND parent_id IS NULL
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 20

Replies to a specific comment, sorted by score
SELECT * FROM Comments
WHERE parent_id = comment_123
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Lazy Loading**

Reddit does not load the entire comment tree in one request. The full tree for a popular post could have hundreds of thousands of comments. Instead it uses lazy loading:

Fetch top 20 top-level comments sorted by score

For each top-level comment, fetch the top 3 replies

Deeper levels show a "load more replies" button which triggers a separate request

This keeps initial page load fast regardless of comment tree depth.

Comment Vote Flow

Comment votes follow the exact same Kafka pipeline as post votes. Each comment has its own score counter maintained by the Score Recomputation Worker. The comment sorted order within a thread is recomputed asynchronously after each vote batch.

Hot comments for popular posts are cached in Redis with a short TTL to avoid repeated PostgreSQL queries for the same comment thread.

Bottlenecks in the Comment Service

The Adjacency List pattern works well for fetching one level at a time via lazy loading. The bottleneck is deep recursive fetches if a client tries to load the full tree in one shot. This is prevented by enforcing pagination and depth limits at the API layer. PostgreSQL handles comment writes at the volume Reddit sees comfortably since comments are far less frequent than votes.

## 8\. Search Service

Reddit search covers three entities: posts (by title and content), subreddits (by name and description), and users (by username).

**Storage Engine - Elasticsearch**

Elasticsearch handles full-text search, partial matching, and relevance ranking across all three entity types. Reddit search is primarily keyword-based rather than engagement-weighted like Instagram, but subreddit size and post score are still used as ranking signals.

Elasticsearch Documents

**Post document:**

```
{
  "post_id": "123",
  "title": "Why Rust is taking over systems programming",
  "content": "A deep dive into memory safety...",
  "subreddit": "programming",
  "subreddit_id": "456",
  "author": "harry_dev",
  "score": 15000,
  "posted_at": "2026-06-10T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Subreddit document:**

```
{
  "subreddit_id": "456",
  "name": "programming",
  "description": "Computer programming discussion",
  "member_count": 5000000
}
```

Post score and subreddit member count act as ranking signals. A highly upvoted post in a large subreddit ranks above a low-score post in a tiny subreddit for the same search query.

Keeping Elasticsearch in Sync

The Search Indexing Worker consumes from the post.transcoded and post.created Kafka topics for new posts. Score updates are batched and synced to Elasticsearch periodically rather than on every vote, since exact scores in search results do not need to be real-time.

Hot search queries are cached in Redis with a short TTL to reduce Elasticsearch load for popular searches.

**Bottlenecks in Search**

Same as Instagram and Spotify. Redis caching for hot queries filters the majority of repeat traffic before hitting Elasticsearch. Horizontal scaling of the Elasticsearch cluster handles the remaining query volume.

## 10\. Resilience and Fault Tolerance

**Redis Sorted Sets for feeds** mean feed reads never touch the Posts DB in the happy path. If PostgreSQL is slow or temporarily unavailable, users continue seeing their feeds from Redis. New posts stop appearing until the DB recovers, but existing feed content is unaffected.

**Kafka durability** means no vote is ever lost even during traffic spikes. Votes sit in Kafka until the Score Recomputation Worker processes them. A viral post generating 100,000 votes per hour does not overwhelm the system because Kafka absorbs the burst and workers process at their own pace.

**Vote debouncing** prevents the Score Recomputation Worker from being overwhelmed on viral posts. Batching vote events in 5-second windows reduces recomputation overhead by orders of magnitude while keeping scores acceptably fresh.

**Idempotency at two layers** for votes: Redis check on the hot path and a PostgreSQL UNIQUE constraint as a safety net. A user can never vote twice on the same post even under retry conditions or network failures.

**Adjacency List lazy loading** prevents comment fetches from becoming unbounded. Enforcing depth limits and pagination at the API layer protects PostgreSQL from runaway recursive queries.

**Cassandra replication** for any high-volume write stores ensures no data loss under node failures.

**CDN caching** for media means profile photos, post images, and video chunks are served from edge nodes globally with no origin involvement for cache hits.
